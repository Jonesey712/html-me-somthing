    <h1>The Early Years</h1>
    <p>My first job was with a company called MarJem Diversified. We worked with the Reserves doing janitorial work. We followed their schedule of one weekend a month, which was great for a high schooler. However, at the same time I worked at the Sheraton Hotel in Westport in the restaurant as a server, busser, room service, and hostess. I left and came back from college and found a job working at Longhorn Steakhouse first as a server, then also as a host. I left there when I was offered the opportunity to work for Macy's in their call center. I worked in Customer Service and as a Research Analyst, which is where my intrest in technology really began. It would still be a while before I fully dabbled in it, though. </p>
    <h2>Present Day</h2>
    <p>Today I work for Scrubs and Beyond; a company that through retail stores and onsite events, sells scrubs and various accessories. I started off in the Customer Service department and was promoted to Project Coordinator for our Events team. After two years, I made the choice to change departments and positions. I am currently an Accounting Assistant in our Accounts Receivable department. There, I manage several accounts by solving billing issues, sending out statements, updating documents, and answering the phones and e-mails.</p>

        <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    <p>For the future, I am unsure of what I would like to do. For the sake of having experience working both front end and back end, I would like to try being a full stack developer. I've learned to think about the future, but not get so far ahead of myself as to lose sight of where I currently am. I would be happy for any opportunity to learn more and develop my skills.</p>
